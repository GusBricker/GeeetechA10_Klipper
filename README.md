# Geeetech A10 Klipper (2020 version)

The printer.cfg is configured for a printer with the following modifications:
- BLTouch
- TMC2209 on X,Y,Z (wired in legacy mode - aka dropped into the GT2560v4 board)
- BMG Clone Extruder
- Glass bed
- Magnum clone hotend
- Modified part cooling fan (which moves the BLTouch X/Y offset slightly)

Other nice things:
- Action commands for filament runout
- Filament runout sensor enabled
